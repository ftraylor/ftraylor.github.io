I am a student at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I am working to earn my MS in Social Data Analytics and Research in order to further build upon the research capacities I developed during my undergraduate degree (BA Sociology). Upon graduation from UT Dallas, I plan to earn a Ph.D. in Sociology and perform research at a university or other public or nonprofit institution. I am primarily interested in conducting research into the public understanding and opinions of science, especially climate change, and I am also interested in environmental sustainability, religious life, and survey research methodology.
